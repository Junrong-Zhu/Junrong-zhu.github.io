I am a senior undergraduate student at the School of Integrated Circuits, Nanjing University, and will be pursuing my Ph.D. in the School of Computer Science at Peking University. My research interests primarily lie in computer architecture, with a focus on CXL, near-data computing, and hardware-software co-design.
